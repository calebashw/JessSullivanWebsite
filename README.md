# Website for Jessica Sullivan, Personal Trainer
## Made by Caleb Ash

## Description:
This is a static website made for Jessica Sullivan, a Philadelphia-based personal trainer. She wanted a simple landing page she could refer clients to and get new clients information, if necessary. It's developed using React, Javascript, CSS, and Ant Design (a component library). It is hosted via Render.

It contains three pages split into three components, along with a NavBar component that's persistent across all three pages. It's designed to the liking of Jess, who went over and approved the design decisions to make sure she was happy with the website. It makes use of a form that sends her the basic information (including basic fitness information) of potential new clients to her email, making use of the EmailJS API for free.

Overall this saved her $200/month, as she had previously been using a website maker and hoster that charged her $200/month, an unnecessary expense considering her needs. She now gets all she needs out of her website for free.

**NOTE:**
**PLEASE DO NOT** use the form feature if you're not interested in her servives out of a courtesy to her. I promise it works but using it will spam her email.
